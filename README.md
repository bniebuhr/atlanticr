The tropical and subtropical forests along the coast and interior of
South America used to have one of the largest forests in the world – the
Atlantic Forest – with more than 1.6 million km² spanning Brazil,
Argentina, and Paraguay. The
[ATLANTIC](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)1939-9170.AtlanticPapers)
includes a series of Data Papers about the community composition and
distribution of plants and animals from the Atlantic Forest. These
papers are a fundamental tool for both scientists and policy makers.

The goal of this package is to provide data from the ATLANTIC, a series
of data papers by Ecology on biodiversity data from the Atlantic Forest.
Currently, there are 17 data sets: nine about vertebrates, two about
vertebrate traits, two about invertebrates, three about interactions
animal-plant, one about plant, and one about spatial data.
