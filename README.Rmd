The tropical and subtropical forests along the coast and interior of South America used to have one of the largest forests in the world – the Atlantic Forest – with more than 1.6 million km² spanning Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The [ATLANTIC](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)1939-9170.AtlanticPapers) includes a series of Data Papers about the community composition, distribution of plants and animals, and environmental characteristics from the Atlantic Forest. These papers are a fundamental tool for both scientists and policy makers.

The goal of this package is to provide data from the ATLANTIC, a series of data papers by Ecology on biodiversity data from the Atlantic 
Forest. Currently, there are 17 data sets: nine about vertebrates, two about vertebrate traits, two about invertebrates, three about interactions animal-plant, one about plant, and one about spatial data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `atlanticr` from GitHub with:
